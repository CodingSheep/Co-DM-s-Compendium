# Co-DM's Compendium
A Discord.py bot meant to aid Game Masters in TTRPG games by assisting in the creation and storage of NPCs, Towns, Locations, and more using ChatGPT and SQL.

## Features
- **ChatGPT Integration**
  - Generate NPCs, cities, locales, bounties, and more with or without added context using OpenAI's ChatGPT API.
  - Context-aware responses for more immersive storytelling.
- **Data Persistance**
  - Save generated responses in a SQL server for future reference.

## TODO (In no particular order):
- Continued Advanced Context for ChatGPT
  - Explore and implement advanced context handling for more dynamic and evolving narratives.
- Google Gemini Integration
  - Create an implementation of existing ChatGPT functionality using Google Gemini once an API is released.
  - General conclusions online mark Gemini as being better at creative writing. This makes it an interesting choice
