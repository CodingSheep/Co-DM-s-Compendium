# Co-DM's Compendium
A Discord.py bot meant to aid me in D&amp;D 5e games ran over Discord.

Project Goals:
 - Play additional sounds as to not interrupt existing Discord Bots playing background music (Completed)
 - Query and access file paths stored in a locally hosted MySQL database (Completed)
 - Limit certain Bot commands to admin only (TODO)
 - Expand SQL functionality to include codexes for creatures encounted (TODO)
